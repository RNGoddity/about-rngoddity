## 🎨 About  

**RNGoddity** is a microstudio exploring the edge where structure meets chance.  

We build modular frameworks, painterly game worlds, and local-first tools — always on the cusp of potential. 

---

## 🧩 Current Frameworks  

- **Essence** — *Godot (GDScript / C#)*  
  A data-driven, modular-first framework for any game — like a backend game builder.  
  Define systems, data, and logic declaratively to assemble emergent gameplay.  

- **Bedframe** — *Python*  
  Local-first, lightweight web tools, creative coding environments, and tiny servers that run forever offline.

## 🧠 The eVector Framework  

**eVector** (*Electronic Vector*) is our term for directed digital agents — structured AI assistants that act like intelligent pair-programmers, editors, or design collaborators.  

At RNGoddity, **eVectors** are used daily to:  
- brainstorm and stress-test design logic  
- draft and refine text, code comments, and documentation  
- prototype tone, pacing, and concept language  

> **Important:** Every line of code, every piece of writing, and every creative decision is authored, reviewed, and approved by a human — the **eVector Project Director**.  
> eVectors assist in reflection and iteration, but they never replace human intent.

## 🪞 Philosophy — Controlled Randomness  

> *“The dice fall where they may — and may serendipity catch your gaze.”*  
> — RNGoddity  

Randomness here isn’t chaos; it’s collaboration.  
The systems roll the dice — but meaning only appears when **...AHA!**
